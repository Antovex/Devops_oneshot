## üö¶ What is CI/CD?

**Continuous Integration (CI):**
- Developers merge code changes frequently into a shared repository.
- Automated builds and tests run to catch issues early.

**Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):**
- Code is automatically prepared for release to production (delivery) or actually deployed (deployment).
- Ensures software is always in a deployable state.

---

## üí° Core Concepts & Benefits
- **Automation:** Reduces manual work, increases reliability.
- **Feedback:** Fast feedback on code quality and integration issues.
- **Quality:** Automated testing and checks improve code quality.
- **Speed:** Faster releases, less time spent on manual deployment.
- **Collaboration:** Encourages frequent, small changes and teamwork.

## üõ†Ô∏è CI/CD Pipeline Stages

1. **Source:** Code pushed to version control (e.g., GitHub)
2. **Build:** Compile code, resolve dependencies
3. **Test:** Run automated tests (unit, integration, etc.)
4. **Package:** Bundle application for deployment
5. **Deploy:** Release to staging/production environments
6. **Monitor:** Track application health and feedback

---

## üöÄ Popular Tools Overview
- **Jenkins:** Open-source automation server
- **GitHub Actions:** Native CI/CD for GitHub repos
- **GitLab CI:** Integrated with GitLab
- **CircleCI, Travis CI, Azure Pipelines, etc.**

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start Example: GitHub Actions

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in your repo:

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices
- Keep pipelines simple and fast
- Run tests in parallel where possible
- Fail fast: stop pipeline on first error
- Use secrets for sensitive data
- Version control your pipeline configs
- Monitor and review pipeline results

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting
- **Build fails?** Check logs for missing dependencies or syntax errors
- **Tests fail?** Run tests locally to debug
- **Deployment fails?** Check environment configs and credentials
- **Pipeline slow?** Optimize steps, use caching

## üìù Quick Reference

| Stage   | Example Tool/Command         |
|---------|-----------------------------|
| Source  | `git push`                  |
| Build   | `npm run build`             |
| Test    | `npm test`                  |
| Package | `docker build -t app .`     |
| Deploy  | `kubectl apply -f deploy/`  |
| Monitor | `Prometheus`, `Grafana`     |
